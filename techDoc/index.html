            <p>Rust is a multi-paradigm, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is designed for
                performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but provides
                memory safety without using garbage collection.</p>
            <p>Rust has been the "most loved programming language" in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey for several
                consecutive years. It is used in systems programming, web assembly, and even embedded devices.</p>
            <p>Key features include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Zero-cost abstractions</li>
                <li>Guaranteed memory safety</li>
                <li>Threads without data races</li>
                <li>Trait-based generics</li>
                <li>Pattern matching</li>
                <li>Type inference</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To start using Rust, you need to install it on your system. The recommended way to install Rust is via
                <code>rustup</code>, the Rust version management tool.</p>
            <p>On Unix-like operating systems (Linux and macOS), you can install <code>rustup</code> with the following
                command in your terminal:</p>
            <pre><code>curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh</code></pre>
            <p>On Windows, download and run the <code>rustup-init.exe</code> installer. After installation, you can
                verify it by checking the version:</p>
            <pre><code>rustc --version</code></pre>
            <p>If you see the version number, commit hash, and commit date, you are ready to go!</p>
        </section>

            <header>Common Concepts</header>
            <p>Let's look at variables. In Rust, variables are immutable by default. This is one of many nudges Rust
                gives you to write code that takes advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that Rust offers.</p>
            <p>When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can't change that value. To make it
                mutable, you add <code>mut</code> in front of the variable name.</p>
            <pre><code>let x = 5;
let mut y = 10;
y = 15; // This is valid
// x = 6; // This would be a compile-time error</code></pre>
            <p>Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile
                time. The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Ownership_System">
            <header>Ownership System</header>
            <p>Ownership is Rust's most unique feature and has deep implications for the rest of the language. It
                enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector.</p>
            <p>There are three main rules of ownership:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each value in Rust has a <code>owner</code>.</li>
                <li>There can only be one owner at a time.</li>
                <li>When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Consider the <code>String</code> type. When we assign a String to another variable, the ownership is
                transferred (moved), and the original variable is no longer valid.</p>
            <pre><code>let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;

// println!("{}, world!", s1); // This would return an error because s1 was moved to s2.</code></pre>
            <p>If we want to deeply copy the heap data of the String, not just the stack data, we can use a common
                method called <code>clone</code>.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Pattern_Matching">
            <header>Pattern Matching</header>
            <p>Rust has an extremely powerful control flow construct called <code>match</code> that allows you to
                compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute code based on which pattern matches.</p>
            <p>Patterns can be made up of literals, variable names, wildcards, and many other things.</p>
            <pre><code>enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter => 25,
    }
}</code></pre>
            <p>The code associated with each arm is an expression, and the resultant value of the expression in the
                matching arm is the value that gets returned for the entire <code>match</code> expression.</p>
            <p>Another useful pattern matching construct is <code>if let</code>, which lets you handle values that match
                one pattern while ignoring the rest.</p>

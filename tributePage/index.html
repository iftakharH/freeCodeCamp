                Alan Mathison Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst,
                philosopher, and theoretical biologist. He was highly influential in the development of theoretical
                computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing
                machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.
